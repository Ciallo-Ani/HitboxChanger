# HitboxChanger
This fork is designed as a drop in replacement for https://github.com/Peak-CDE/HitboxChanger on CSGO while also supporting other source engine games.

All current features are fully supported and no changes to any plugins depending on HitboxChanger are needed.

# Building
Note: Building for CSGO no longer requires the modified hl2sdk-CSGO.
- Follow build instructions from https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Building_SourceMod
